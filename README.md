3. **Members log daily meals and expenses**
4. **System tracks entries**
5. **Admin closes month for settlement**
6. **System calculates settlements**

**Example Settlement Table:**

| User  | Meals | Meal Cost | Expenses Paid | Settlement         |
|-------|-------|-----------|--------------|--------------------|
| Alice | 50    | ₹2,000    | ₹3,500       | Receives ₹1,500    |
